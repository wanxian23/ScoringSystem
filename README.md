This is my first complex individual coding project.
I learnt all the frontend and backend development knowledge from a external mentor that hired by my school. 
Since it is my first project, my skills might be limited and bad, but it is a huge achievement for me to successfully build a website and connected with a MariaDB DBMS using Xampp.

I just build the website but didn't actually host it.

Im sorry that you might failed to run this becuase my SQL file has lost.
